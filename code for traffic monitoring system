# Pseudocode:
# 1. Import necessary libraries.
# 2. Set up the API key and base URL.
# 3. Define a function to fetch traffic data based on user input (start point and destination).
# 4. Process the API response to extract relevant traffic information.
# 5. Display the traffic data (current conditions, travel time, incidents).
# 6. Allow the user to input different locations and repeat the process.

# Implementation:

import requests

    # Base URL for traffic data
    base_url = "https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json"

        "key": api_key,
        "departure_time": "now"
    }
    
    # Make the API request
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)

destination = "Hyderabad"
